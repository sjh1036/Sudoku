This is my Sudoku Solver!

The program is written in Java and uses recursion to test every combination of numbers and brute-force a solution to the given Sudoku puzzle (if there is one).

To use: Run the main function of the 'Sudoku.java' file and provide the absolute path to your Sudoku puzzle text file (in the format of the puzzles provided in the 'src' folder).
